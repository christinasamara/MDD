# Multidimensional Data Structures

This project explores various multidimensional data structures, such as hashing, R-trees, Quad-trees, Range trees, and K-d trees. The code is provided for reference and review purposes only. You are not granted the right to use, modify, or distribute this code for any purpose other than personal review. For any other use, please contact the author.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of my academic coursework during my 5th semester at Computer Engineering and Informatics Department at University of Patras. It allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the applications of multidimensional data structures in data organization and retrieval.

## Components

This project comprises several essential components for handling multidimensional data:

1. **LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing)**:
   - LSH is a technique for approximate nearest neighbor search. It can efficiently search for approximate matches in high-dimensional spaces. The LSH implementation in this project enables approximate similarity search within your dataset.

2. **KD-Tree**:
   - A KD-Tree is a data structure used for multidimensional data organization and retrieval. It efficiently divides space into partitions to enable nearest neighbor search. The KD-Tree implementation in this project allows for efficient searches in multidimensional space.

3. **Quadtree**:
   - A Quadtree is a tree data structure where each internal node has exactly four children. It is commonly used for spatial indexing and spatial partitioning. The Quadtree implementation allows you to organize and search multidimensional data efficiently.

4. **R-tree**:
   - An R-tree is a tree data structure used for spatial indexing, particularly useful in geographical information systems (GIS) and multidimensional data. The project includes an R-tree implementation for efficient spatial indexing and search.

5. **Range Tree**:
   - A Range Tree is a data structure that supports efficient range queries on multidimensional data. The project provides an implementation of a Range Tree for effective range search within your dataset.

## Features

- Customizable Parameters: Each component allows you to customize parameters to adapt the data structures to your specific use case.
- Example Datasets: The code includes example datasets, but you can easily adapt them to your own data.
- Nearest Neighbor Search: KD-Tree and LSH enable efficient nearest neighbor search, while Quadtree, R-tree, and Range Tree support various multidimensional data search operations.

## Database Details

The dataset in this project includes information about individuals and their educational background, particularly focusing on the fields of computer science and engineering. The database consists of the following fields:

- **SURNAME**: The last name of the individual.
- **NAME**: The first name of the individual.
- **AWARDS**: The number of awards or distinctions received by the individual.
- **EDUCATION**: A brief summary of the individual's educational journey and achievements.
